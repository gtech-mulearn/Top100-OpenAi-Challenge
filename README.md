# Chat with Video 

### Note to the reviewers

Synopysor-Pro project, done by Suryan and Chat-With-Video project, done by me have been merged into a single project titled "[Synopsis Pro - Chat with Video](https://github.com/Top-100-Coders/Synopysor-Pro)" in the last day of the finals since both of the projects are trying to solve the same pain point. Since I don't have much code contribution in the Synopsis Pro code repository, I am submitting this repo as well for code review.

### Problem Statement

Accessing and extracting valuable information from long videos can be time-consuming and challenging. Users often need a more efficient way to comprehend video content, obtain concise summaries, and interact with the content through a conversational interface. The need for a tool that combines video transcription, summarization, and chatbot capabilities arises to address these challenges.

### Solution

Our proposed solution is a multi-functional tool that takes video input, performs transcription using speech-to-text technology, generates a concise summary of the video, and incorporates a chatbot for interactive discussions about the content.

### Code
The code of the project is present in chat.py file

### Run Command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run chat.py
```
