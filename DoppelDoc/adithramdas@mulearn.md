## DoppelDoc
DoppelDoc is a new-age software that efficiently identifies duplicate resumes using advanced text processing and machine-learning techniques. Users can upload multiple PDF resumes, which are then analyzed for duplication through cosine similarity calculations. The application leverages OpenAI's GPT model for intelligent text extraction and employs a HashingVectorizer for consistent vectorization. Results, including duplicate status, are dynamically displayed on a user-friendly interface, enhanced with AJAX for real-time updates without page reloads.

## Key Contribution
1) Integrated components and managed the Flask app.
2) PDF manipulation
3) OpenAI API integration, Prompt engineering.
4) Algorithm selection - To select the most suitable and efficient option for calculating the similarity between resumes.
5) AJAX - For proper UI management.

# Challenges
1) Finding appropriate parsing library and standardization method.
2) Selection of Algorithm for identifying similarity between resumes.
3) Proper rendering of the  output page
4) DB integration
